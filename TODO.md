## Current Status: Completed ✅

## Summary of Changes Made:
1. **Routes.php**: Removed all routes pointing to deleted Register, Login, and Dashboard controllers
2. **UserModel.php**: Added missing methods:
   - findUserByEmail() - Find user by email address
   - createAccount() - Create new user with password hashing
   - getDashboardStats() - Get role-based dashboard statistics
3. **Login View**: Updated form action from 'login/authenticate' to 'login'
4. **Register View**: Updated form action from 'register/store' to 'register'
5. **Dashboard View**: Completely redesigned to use template structure and display user data and statistics
6. **Auth Controller**: Fixed view path from 'dashboard/index' to 'auth/dashboard' and corrected all redirect URLs
7. **Database**: Ran migrations to create the users table

## ✅ Login Error Fixed!

The "Whoops!" error after login has been resolved by:
- Fixing the dashboard view path in Auth controller
- Correcting all redirect URLs to use '/login' instead of '/auth/login'
- Running database migrations to create the users table
- Ensuring all dependencies are properly configured

## ✅ Registration Form Fixed!

The registration issue has been resolved by:
- Fixed role options in register form to match database schema
- Changed from "Student/Instructor/Admin" to "User/Admin" to match validation rules
- Added confirm password field for better security
- Added CSRF protection to both login and register forms
- Now users can successfully register accounts in the database

## Next Steps:
- Test the complete authentication flow (register → login → dashboard → logout)
- Verify all functionality works correctly
